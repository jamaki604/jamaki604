## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m looking for

I am currently seeking a long-term opportunity where I can grow as a software developer and become an integral part of a collaborative, supportive teamâ€”one that feels like a professional family. Iâ€™m passionate about honing my development skills, contributing to meaningful projects, and learning from experienced peers in a nurturing environment. While my primary focus is on software development, my background and continued interest in design, photography, and visual storytelling remain important to me. I hope to bring that creative perspective into my work, blending functionality with thoughtful design. My goal is to find a place where I can build lasting relationships, continually challenge myself, and contribute to innovative solutions that are both technically sound and visually engaging.
