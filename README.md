## 🤙 About Me

I am a software developer with experience delivering mobile and full-stack applications across diverse technology stacks. I prioritize clean architecture, scalability, and thoughtful design, selecting tools based on technical fit rather than specialization. I built, shipped, and maintain production-grade applications across iOS and Android, with hands-on ownership of architecture, backend integration, subscriptions, deployment pipelines, and long-term scalability.

As the founder and lead developer of GUNDEX, I designed and launched a cross-platform mobile application used by collectors and players in the trading card community. I built the entire system end-to-end — Flutter frontend, Supabase backend, RESTful API integration, authentication, database architecture, pricing logic, subscription handling, and CI/CD workflows.

I care deeply about clean architecture, performance optimization, and building products that feel polished and intentional. My background in design and photography influences how I approach UI/UX — balancing technical precision with visual clarity.

I’m seeking a long-term opportunity where I can contribute at a high level, grow alongside strong engineers, and help build products that scale.
